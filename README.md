This is the back end of the project for CSC1147 Foundations of AI. 
This project compares two AI APIs from Hugging Face in terms of their accuracy in answering history based questions. 
This is the code for the back end proxy server which is deployed on Render.
The reason for deploying on Render is that I was facing a CORS issue while deploying this on ancient brain.
This backend uses Node.js with the Express.js framework
